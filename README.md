# MATLAB Projects
This repository includes the MATLAB projects I have worked on in my undergraduate degree.

### [V-L Mass Balance]()
This project calculates the output volume of a VLE apparatus given a binary feed with its composition, initial volume, and temperature.

### [Sedimentation]()
This project makes use of MATLAB interface tracking to obtain the experimental settling curves for a sedimentation experiment on the robustness and validity of hindered settling index correlations popularly used. A video of the settling process is used as input and MATLAB outputs a height vs. time graph of the settling process.

### [Fugacity of Species in Solution]()
This project computes several fugacity coefficients in a multi-component gas/vapor system using virial EOS and the cubic EOS (van der Waals, Redlich Kwong, Soave Redlick Kwong, and Peng Robinson). Includes a user manual.

### [Wilson Equation and UNIFAC]()
This project determines the Wilson model parameters for a given system with a given experimental data at a set temperature. Additionally, the project also includes a program that calculates the activity coefficients for a multicomponent liquid mixture using the UNIFAC model. Includes a user manual.

### [Various Problems as Exercise]()
This folder is a compilation of all the other problems and exercises I have solved using MATLAB. This includes codes used for quizzes that require basic MATLAB computation, as well as codes for exams on topics such as unit step response, non-isothermal CSTR response, root locus diagrams, PID controllers, pole-zero plots, time delay TF models, and Simulink.
